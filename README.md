## How I Work

Architecture at Angola LNG is not theoretical. Every review, every design decision, every governance gate exists because system failure in an LNG facility has consequences beyond an SLA breach. That context shaped how I think:

- **Identify failure modes before success paths**
- **Frameworks before fixes — durable abstractions over one-off solutions**
- **Security as an architectural property, not a layer added at the end**
- **Documentation that outlives the person who wrote it**

After 12+ years in this environment, I've also learned that the best technical decisions go nowhere without trust, clear communication, and relationships built over time. Architecture is as much a people function as a technical one.
